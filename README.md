# Arduino Garden Bot
Well, this is just a DIY project started due to lazzyness for watering plant. While planning to make automated system to water plants, I came across Arduino open hardware development board which is an excellent place to start, along with esp8266 wifi module which made more room to additional functionalitues like: NTP sync with DS1307. 
This automated gardening system waters plants every alternate days (as I have set this way.)

Currently working on, which is in Progress: watering the plants only when theyâ€™re thirsty, turning on supplemental lights based on how much natural sunlight is received, and alerting me if the temperature drops below a plant-healthy level

I am open to constructive criticism, but go easy because just about everything in this project was a first for me.


For a brief introduction to this project, i am in process of creating a introduction video which will take few days to go live.
